# 🩺 Insurance Charges — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores a health insurance dataset to understand what factors most influence medical insurance charges.  
The goal is to analyze the data, uncover patterns, and communicate findings clearly with professional visualizations.

---

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Load and inspect the dataset
- Explore numeric & categorical distributions
- Compare insurance charges across groups (smokers vs non-smokers, regions)
- Visualize relationships between BMI, age, smoking status, and charges
- Identify patterns and generate insights using data storytelling

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Smoking status is the strongest driver of insurance cost**
  - Once encoded, it shows the highest correlation with charges
  - Smokers have significantly higher median and upper-range costs

- **BMI and age impact insurance charges**
  - Higher BMI and age are associated with increased charges
  - **Smoking amplifies** the effect of BMI and age dramatically

- **Regional differences**
  - Southeast region shows higher insurance charges
  - Effect is largely explained by a higher proportion of smokers in this dataset
